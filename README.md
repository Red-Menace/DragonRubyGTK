# DragonRuby GTK

Some stuff for the Game ToolKit:

- **ctags.md** - markdown conversion of emacs ctags from the current release, cleaned up and tweaked for consistent displays (more or less) in MacDown.app, HTML, BBEdit, and GitHub.

- A couple of example projects that use a custom class to get RGB values from color palette hashes using a name or index:
    - **Color Sampler** - an example that shows samples of eight color sets including named colors such as HTML and crayons, and indexed colors from rainbow and gray palettes.
    - **Boxes** - an example that displays color swatches and names from the HTML color set, and a moving display of boxes of random sizes and colors.

- **Icons** - some image files for project folder and application icons.
