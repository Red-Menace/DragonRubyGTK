# DragonRuby GTK

Some stuff for the Game ToolKit:

- **Icons** - some image files for project folder and application icons.

- **Sounds** - sound effects, beep and click sounds, etc

- A couple of example projects that use a custom class to get RGB values from color palette hashes using a name or index:
    - **Color Sampler** - an example that shows samples of eight color sets including named colors such as HTML and crayons, and indexed colors from rainbow and gray palettes.  [v53/1.17]
    - **Boxes** - an example that displays color swatches and names from the HTML color set, and a moving display of boxes of random sizes and colors.  [v53/1.17]

- **Deflection** - a small puzzle game where you change the course of the ball by placing deflectors in its path, in order to hit all target squares. [v154/5.5]
