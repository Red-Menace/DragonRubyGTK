# DragonRuby GTK

Some stuff for the Game ToolKit:

- ctags.md - markdown conversion of emacs ctags

- A couple of example projects that use a custom class to get RGB values from color palette hashes using a name or index:
    - Color_Sampler - an example that shows samples of eight color sets including named colors such as HTML and crayons, and indexed colors from rainbow and gray palettes.
    - Boxes - an example that displays color swatches and names from the HTML color set, and a moving display of boxes of random sizes and colors.
